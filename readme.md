# screp-js-file

A pure Javascript version of [screp](https://github.com/icza/screp), a StarCraft: Remastered replay file parser, compiled from the original Go version using [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

screp (StarCraft: Brood War Replay Parser) is a library for extracting information from StarCraft replay files. This library uses a compiled version of the original library recompiled for Javascript. This specific library is designed to for use in Node on local filesâ€”if you need to parse file buffers directly or use screp in the browser, try [screp-js](https://github.com/msikma/screp-js).

## Installation

This library can be installed through npm:

```
npm i --save screp-js-file
```

## Usage

To use, run `Screp.parseFile()` on a path to a local file.

```js
const Screp = require('screp-js-file')

const processRep(filepath) {
  try {
    const res = await Screp.parseFile(filepath)
    return res
  }
  catch (err) {
    // If something went wrong, 'err' will be an Error object containing a string thrown by Go.
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```
